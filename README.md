To assess the impact of extreme events on the deterioration of roads, we have considered two
main climatic events: (1) Flooding and (2) Extreme heat.

The extreme heat is assessed using:
(a) Extreme heat climatic factor TXx. A TXx extreme heat climatic factor where daily temperature exceeds 35 C
(b) Number of days daily temperature exceeds TXx. The number of days a year where the daily temperature exceeds 35 C

The flooding variable is assessed using:
(a) Flood events. Data from Dartmouth will indicate whether a flood ever occured in the location in the study years.
   This has been represented using a binary variable (1 or 0).
(b) TMI. The annual TMI changes will represent variations in climatic zones
(c) Potential evapotranspiration. The potential evapotranspiration (monthly) should indicate the level of wetness of the ground
